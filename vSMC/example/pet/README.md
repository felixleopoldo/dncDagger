# Positron emission tomography compartmental models

This example implement algorithms of Bayesian model comparison for the Positron
emission tomography compartmental models as found in:

Zhou, Y., Aston, J. A., & Johansen, A. M. (2013). Bayesian model comparison for
compartmental models with applications in positron emission tomography. Journal
of Applied Statistics, 40(5), 993-1016.

## Algorithms

- `pet_is`: Importance sampling
- `pet_pmcmc`: Population Markov chain Monte Carlo
- `pet_smc`: Sequential Monte Carlo
